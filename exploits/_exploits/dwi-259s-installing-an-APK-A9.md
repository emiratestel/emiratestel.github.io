- Ensure the TV box is connected to the same network as the device you plan to use as an ADB client.
- Turn on developer mode
- Enable USB debugging
- Install [platform tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) for your PC.
  - There are third party apps for Android/iOS devices that will work as an ADB client, however platform tools is the safest option. 
- On the eLifeON home screen, press the red button
- Scroll to Ethernet or WiFi (depends on your connection type)
- Find the local IPv4 address (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)
{% include note.html type="info" content="ADB command syntax may vary. Do research if unsure." %}
- Use `adb connect` followed by the local IPv4 address
  - This may result in an error on the client. If the TV box displays a prompt, clicking Allow will likely resolve this issue upon retrying.
- Install an APK
{% include note.html type="tip" content="Installing a launcher as the first program is recommended." %}
{% include note.html type="warning" content="The TV box may soft reset if left connected to the modem." %}
